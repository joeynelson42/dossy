### Server
Have you ever been to a restaurant? Imagine your waitress comes up to you. She asks what you would like. You ask for a double order of pancakes and some fresh-squeezed orange juice. She writes it down and takes it back to the kitchen.

When she comes back she has your order and you soon enter a world of syrupy joy.

A server works in much the same way (hence, the shared name I assume). You type in a URL (think about your order of pancakes) and give it to a server (smoky waitress) who then sends back a webpage (yummy food).

A server is simply a computer really far away that is waiting to take your order and give you the information you desire.
