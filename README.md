I am working on this dictionary of dev-related words with definitions for a non-dev world. In a perfect world it will be used for a future project, in our world it will likely be shelved when a shinier idea comes to mind.

Pull requests with words or definitions or both words and definitions or even some spelling/grammatical corrections are very welcome.

Imagine the waitress at your local diner. She asks what you would like and you ask for an order of pancakes. She writes it down and takes it back to the kitchen. When she returns she (hopefully) has your pancakes.

A server works in much the same way*. In a __web browser__ you type in a __URL__ (think about your order of pancakes) and give it to a server (waitress) who then sends back a __web page__ (pancakes).

A server is simply a __computer__ really far away that is waiting to take your order and give you the information you desire.

*Hence the shared name (I assume)
