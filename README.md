### Server
Imagine the waitress at your local diner. She asks what you would like and you ask for an order of pancakes. She writes it down and takes it back to the kitchen. When she returns she (hopefully) has your pancakes.

A server works in much the same way*. You type in a __URL__ (think about your order of pancakes) and give it to a server (waitress) who then sends back a __webpage__ (pancakes).

A server is simply a __computer__ really far away that is waiting to take your order and give you the information you desire.

* hence, the shared name (I assume)
